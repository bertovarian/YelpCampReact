# YelpCampReact - Campground Review Application

YelpCampReact is a full-stack web application inspired by Colt Steele's original **YelpCamp** project. This version builds upon the foundation of the classic project with modern improvements, including a React-based frontend, integration of interactive maps using Mapbox, weather forecasting via OpenWeatherMap API, and enhanced user experience with responsive design and advanced features like clustering for map markers. Unlike the original project, which used EJS templates and a more backend-centric approach, this version leverages React for a dynamic and component-based frontend architecture.
